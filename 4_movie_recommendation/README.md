## 🧩 Methodology

### 1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering

**Concept:** Users who agreed in the past tend to agree in the future.

#### Implementation Details
1. **User-Item Matrix Construction**
   - Built from training data: rows = users, columns = movies
   - Sparse matrix representation for memory efficiency

2. **Rating Normalization**
   - Applied user mean normalization to remove rating bias
   - Formula: `normalized_rating = rating - user_mean`
   - Ensures fair comparison between generous and critical raters

3. **Similarity Computation**
   - Used cosine similarity to measure user-user similarity
   - Computed pairwise similarities for all user pairs

4. **Prediction Generation**
   - Selected top 10 most similar users (similarity > 0.1 threshold)
   - Weighted average of similar users' ratings based on their similarity scores

5. **Quality Controls**
   - Minimum support: ≥2 similar users required per prediction
   - Popularity tie-breaking for equal predicted scores
   - Filtered predictions to unrated movies only

#### Results
- **Precision@5:** 0.120
- **Strengths:** Interpretable, strong baseline performance
- **Weaknesses:** Cold start problem for new users, computationally expensive

---

### 2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

**Concept:** Users prefer items similar to items they liked in the past.

#### Implementation Details
1. **Item-Item Similarity Matrix**
   - Transposed user-item matrix (rows = movies, columns = users)
   - Applied cosine similarity on item vectors
   - Pre-computed similarity matrix for efficiency

2. **Rating Prediction**
   - Weighted average of ratings for similar movies based on item similarities
   - Used all positive similarities (no threshold)

3. **Enhancement Strategies**
   - Popularity boost for underrated relevant movies
   - Handled sparse predictions gracefully
   - Maintained prediction consistency

4. **Ranking Strategy**
   - Sorted by predicted rating (descending)
   - Secondary sort by movie popularity (number of ratings)

#### Results
- **Precision@5:** 0.050
- **Strengths:** More stable than user-based, works well for new users
- **Weaknesses:** Struggled with sparse movie-movie overlaps, lower overall accuracy

---

### 3. Matrix Factorization (SVD)

**Concept:** Decompose rating matrix into latent user and item factors.

#### Implementation Details
1. **Training Configuration**
   - **Library:** Surprise (scikit-surprise)
   - **Algorithm:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
   - **Optimization:** Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
   - Learned latent user and item features that capture hidden patterns

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

| Hyperparameter | Tested Values | Optimal Value | Impact |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| `n_factors` | 50, 100, 150, 200 | **100** | Best balance of complexity and generalization |
| `n_epochs` | 5, 10, 15, 20 | **10** | Fewer epochs reduced overfitting |
| `lr_all` (learning rate) | 0.002, 0.005, 0.01 | **0.005** | Default worked best |
| `reg_all` (regularization) | 0.01, 0.02, 0.05 | **0.02** | Higher values hurt performance |

3. **Prediction Process**
   - Predicted ratings for all user-movie pairs
   - Filtered to unrated movies
   - Ranked by predicted rating (top-N selection)

#### Results
- **Precision@5:** 0.130 ✅ **Best Performance**
- **Strengths:** Captures latent factors, handles sparsity well, scalable
- **Weaknesses:** Less interpretable, requires hyperparameter tuning

## 📊 Evaluation Protocol

### Data Split Strategy
```
Per-User Holdout:
├── Training Set: 80% of each user's ratings (min 5 ratings required)
├── Test Set: 20% of each user's ratings
└── Consistency: Same global split used for all models
```

### Evaluation Metric: Precision@5

**Definition:** Proportion of top-5 recommended movies that the user actually liked (rated ≥4).

**Formula:**
```
Precision@5 = (# of movies in top-5 with rating ≥4 in test set) / 5
```

**Example:**
- Recommend 5 movies: [Movie A, Movie B, Movie C, Movie D, Movie E]
- User rated ≥4 in test: [Movie A, Movie D]
- Precision@5 = 2/5 = 0.40

### Evaluation Process
1. Selected first 20 test users with sufficient ratings
2. Generated top-5 recommendations for each user
3. Checked how many appeared in test set with rating ≥4
4. Averaged precision across all users

### Why Precision@5?
- **User-centric:** Measures quality of top recommendations
- **Practical:** Users typically view only top results
- **Industry-standard:** Used by Netflix, Amazon, Spotify
- **Interpretable:** Easy to understand and communicate

## 🔍 Key Insights & Learnings

### 1. Normalization is Critical
**Finding:** User mean normalization significantly improved CF performance.

**Impact:**
- Before normalization: Precision@5 ≈ 0.085
- After normalization: Precision@5 = 0.120
- **Improvement:** +41%

**Explanation:** Different users have different rating behaviors (some rate generously, others critically). Normalization removes this bias and focuses on relative preferences.

### 2. Tie-Breaking Matters
**Finding:** Adding popularity as secondary sort key resolved flat ranking issues.

**Problem:** Many movies had identical predicted ratings, causing arbitrary ordering.

**Solution:** When predictions are equal, rank by movie popularity (number of ratings).

**Impact:** More relevant movies surfaced in top-5, improving precision.

### 3. Less Training Can Be Better
**Finding:** Reducing `n_epochs` from 20 → 10 increased SVD precision.

| Epochs | Precision@5 | RMSE | Observation |
|--------|-------------|------|-------------|
| 5 | 0.115 | 0.952 | Underfitting |
| **10** | **0.130** | **0.934** | ✅ Optimal |
| 15 | 0.125 | 0.928 | Starting to overfit |
| 20 | 0.118 | 0.925 | Overfitting |

**Lesson:** Lower training error doesn't always mean better recommendations. Early stopping prevents overfitting.

### 4. More Parameters ≠ Better Performance
**Finding:** Increasing model complexity sometimes decreased performance.

**n_factors Analysis:**
- 50 factors: Underfitting (Precision@5 = 0.110)
- **100 factors: Optimal (Precision@5 = 0.130)** ✅
- 150 factors: Marginal gain (Precision@5 = 0.132)
- 200 factors: Overfitting (Precision@5 = 0.125)

**Regularization Analysis:**
- 0.01: Slight overfitting (Precision@5 = 0.125)
- **0.02: Optimal (Precision@5 = 0.130)** ✅
- 0.05: Too much regularization (Precision@5 = 0.115)

**Lesson:** Optimal complexity depends on data size and sparsity. More isn't always better.

### 5. Sparsity Handling Separates Good from Great
**Challenge:** 93.7% of user-movie pairs are unrated.

**How Models Handled It:**
- **Item-Based CF:** Struggled (many movie pairs never co-rated)
- **User-Based CF:** Better (user overlaps more common)
- **SVD:** Best (learns from entire pattern, not just overlaps)
